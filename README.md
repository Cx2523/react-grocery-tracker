This is a Webpack 2 project builder that I built based on this excellent tutorial series:

Out of the box, it is set up for React, Bootstrap, ES6 (via Babel transpiler), and SASS. 
Node is used for package management and to set up separate Development and Production build options.
The Webpack dev server is used and set up for hot module replacement.
